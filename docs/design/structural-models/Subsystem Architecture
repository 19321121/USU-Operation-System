Subsystem Architecture (USU Operation System)

Overview

This architectural design defines the internal structure of the USU Operation System in the overall USU federation project. It follows a “microservices architecture”, where each component provides APIs for communication with other subsystems.

Components and Interfaces

1. User Management Service

Provides:
- IUserAuth (login, logout, token validation)
- IUserProfile (create/update/view profiles)

Requires:
- IDataSecurity (encryption, password hashing)

Description:
Manages authentication and authorisation of USU officers and integrates with Data Security Service to protect credentials.

2. Event Management Service

Provides:
- IEventControl (create, edit, delete events)
	- IEventAccess (list, search, view events)
	
	Requires:
- IUserAuth (verify organiser permissions)
- IBackup (save historical event data)

Description:
Allows officers to manage events, polls and attendance records.

3. Feedback and Review Service

Provides:
- IFeedback (submit, flag, delete feedback)
- IAnalytics (generate feedback summaries

Requires:
- IUserProfile (link feedback to users)
- IDataSecurity (ensure privacy of responses)

Description:
Collects and analyses reviews about USU activities; integrates with other services to maintain integrity and anonymity.

4. Data Security and Backup Service

Provides:
- IDataSecurity (AES encryption, TLS communication)
- IBackup (daily backup, recovery tools)

Requires:
None

Description:
Maintains confidentiality and integrity of stored and transmitted data across all services.

External Interactions
- Connects to “Student Union Management System” for event coordination.
- Exchanges aggregated data with “USU Student App” for event listings and feedback display.

Rationale
Using separate components improves scalability and maintainability.
Each microservice can evolve independently, supporting secure APIs and modular updates.
