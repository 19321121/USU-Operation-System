Quality Requirements for USU Student App

Quality requirements for Data Encryption

Functional Requirement:
The system shall encrypt all sensitive user information, including profile data (name, address, contact details), passwords and membership information.

Quality Requirement (Security):
Sensitive information must be encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols (e.g. TLS for transmission and AES for storage).

Rationale:
Protecting user data is essential to comply with privacy regulations and to maintain trust in the USU Student App. Without encryption, attackers could intercept or compromise user details

Quality requirements for Event Information Management 

Functional Requirement:
The system shall allow users to view, search and interact with event information, including schedules, venues and participation options.

Quality Requirement (Availability and Reliability):
Event information must be available with a system uptime of at least 99.5%.
Updates to event data should be reflected in the app within 2 minutes of being added or modified by administrators.
The system must maintain daily backups of event and membership data to support recovery in case of failure.

Rationale:
Students depend on the app for timely and accurate event information. High availability, responsiveness and reliability ensure the system remains useful for event planning and engagement.
